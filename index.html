        <p>Hi,</p>

        <p>My name is <span class="your-name">[your name]</span>, and I am writing as a local resident and volunteer with the Friends of the Forest group supporting the Protect Portumna Forest Park campaign.</p>

        <p>I am deeply concerned about the proposed development plans for Portumna Forest Park and the lack of meaningful engagement with the local community—particularly with the Protect Portumna Forest Park community group, which has done so much to represent public views in a constructive, organised way.</p>

        <p>Earlier this year, a community survey of 1,095 respondents was conducted, reflecting a wide cross-section of people who live in, visit, and care about Portumna Forest Park. The results show clear opposition to the idea of building tourist accommodation within the forest park, and strong support for protecting and enhancing the park’s natural and recreational value.</p>

        <p>Some key findings include:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>69% want upgraded toilet facilities</li>
          <li>52% want expansion of wildlife habitats</li>
          <li>48% want more seating and rest areas along trails</li>
          <li>43% want better signage for easier navigation</li>
          <li>42% want enhanced maintenance of existing trails and infrastructure</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The survey also highlighted a very reasonable alternative: the derelict hotel site in the town, which directly borders the forest park. It makes far more sense to invest in this site for tourist accommodation, rather than permanently altering the forest environment.</p>

        <p>As someone who values this space for its beauty, biodiversity, and wellbeing benefits, I am asking that you:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Support meaningful engagement with Protect Portumna Forest Park community group in all stages of planning and consultation</li>
          <li>Promote the use of alternative sites—like the derelict hotel—for any tourism infrastructure</li>
          <li>Help ensure that Coillte and its project partners Fáilte Ireland and Galway County Council act transparently and responsibly with the public interest at the centre of their plans</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Portumna Forest Park is a vital natural and public resource. It was never meant to be a commercial venture, and we all have a duty to ensure it remains protected for current and future generations.</p>

        <p>Thank you for your time and attention.</p>

        <p>Regards,<br>
